# Methodology and Approach
## Design Approach
After the first lesson, the team was able to sketch the process and execute the first workflow by running the Camunda BPM Engine on Heroku. Although with a limited functionality. Furthermore, documentation and design plans were crafted and some tests were conducted. The continuous development and adaptations of the solution has been treated as sprints and the vast majority of work has been executed in group work with parts split into individual assignments.

## Collaboration
Git Version control was used in order to work collaboratively on the project. GitHub was used for the versioning of the development increments, as well as to create the technical documentation.

In addition, the team worked with Google Drive to make all scripts, files for Camunda and BPMN along with other documentation available immediately to the whole team independing on location and time. 

## Testing
In order to minimalize defects, various functional tests were conducted. The team moved on along the process bit by bit to avoid long searches for errors. 

## Project Management
Tasks were tracked within Google Drive and assigned to the team members. Since the team only consisted of five team members, no designated project leader was chosen. Tasks were taken by the each team member individually.
